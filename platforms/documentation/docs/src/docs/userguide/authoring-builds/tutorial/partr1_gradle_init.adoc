= Part 1: Initializing the Project

Learn the basics of authoring Gradle by first creating a Java app using Gradle init.

****
**In this section, you will:**

- Initialize a Java project
- Review the directory layout
- Run a Java application
- Produce a Build Scan
- Bundle the application in an archive
****

[[part1_begin]]
== Step 0. Before you Begin

1. Make sure you have <<installation.adoc#installation,Gradle installed>>.

2. Install link:https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/[IntelliJ IDEA].
The Community Edition is a free version of IntelliJ IDEA.

== Step 1. Initializing the Project

Create a new directory called `authoring-tutorial` and `cd` into it:

[source]
----
$ mkdir authoring-tutorial
----
[source]
----
$ cd authoring-tutorial
----

Run `gradle init` and continue with the prompt as indicated below:

[source]
----
$ gradle init

Select type of project to generate:
  1: basic
  2: application
  3: library
  4: Gradle plugin
Enter selection (default: basic) [1..4] 2

Select implementation language:
  1: C++
  2: Groovy
  3: Java
  4: Kotlin
  5: Scala
  6: Swift
Enter selection (default: Java) [1..6] 3

Generate multiple subprojects for application? (default: no) [yes, no] no

Select build script DSL:
  1: Kotlin
  2: Groovy
Enter selection (default: Kotlin) [1..2] 1

Select test framework:
  1: JUnit 4
  2: TestNG
  3: Spock
  4: JUnit Jupiter
Enter selection (default: JUnit Jupiter) [1..4] 4

Project name (default: authoring-tutorial):
Source package (default: authoring.tutorial):

Enter target version of Java (min. 7) (default: 19):
Generate build using new APIs and behavior (some features may change in the next minor release)? (default: no) [yes, no]
----

NOTE: In this tutorial, Kotlin DSL is used to build a simple Java project (as it is the default DSL starting in Gradle 8.2). All examples are macOS based.

== Step 2. Understanding the Directory layout

The *project root directory* contains all source files from your project.

When you are done with Gradle `init`, the directory should look as follows:

----
.
├── gradle                              // <1>
│   └── wrapper
├── gradlew                             // <2>
├── gradlew.bat                         // <2>
├── settings.gradle.kts                 // <3>
└── app
    ├── build.gradle.kts                // <4>
    └── src
        ├── main
        │   └── java                    // <5>
        │       └── demo
        │           └── App.java
        └── test
            └── java                    // <6>
                └── demo
                    └── AppTest.java
----
<1> Generated folder for wrapper files
<2> Gradle wrapper start scripts
<3> Settings file to define build name and subprojects
<4> Build script for `app` subproject
<5> Default Java source folder for `app` subproject
<6> Default Java test source folder for `app` subproject

The `authoring-tutorial` folder is the *root project directory*.
Inside the root project directory are one or more subprojects, build scripts, and the Gradle wrapper.

While the Gradle Wrapper is local to the root project, the Gradle executable is found in the `GRADLE_USER_HOME`.

The `GRADLE_USER_HOME`, which defaults to `USER_HOME/.gradle`, is also where Gradle stores its global configuration properties, initialization scripts, caches, log files and more.

== Step 3. Review the Gradle Files

The `settings.gradle.kts` file has two interesting lines:

.settings.gradle.kts
[source, kotlin]
----
rootProject.name = "authoring-tutorial"
include("app")
----

- `rootProject.name` assigns a name to the build, overriding the default behavior of naming the build after its directory name.
- `include("app")` defines that the build consists of one subproject called `app` that contains its own source code and build logic.

More subprojects can be added by additional `include()` statements.

Our build contains one subproject called `app` representing the Java application we are building.
It is configured in the `app/build.gradle(.kts)` file:

.build.gradle.kts
[source, kotlin]
----
plugins {
    id("application")                                               // <1>
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()                                                  // <2>
}

dependencies {
    testImplementation("org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:5.9.3")     // <3>
    testRuntimeOnly("org.junit.platform:junit-platform-launcher")
    implementation("com.google.guava:guava:32.1.1-jre")             // <4>
}

java {
    toolchain {
        languageVersion.set(JavaLanguageVersion.of(19))             // <5>
    }
}

application {
    mainClass.set("authoring.tutorial.App")                         // <6>
}

tasks.named<Test>("test") {
    useJUnitPlatform()                                              // <7>
}
----
<1> Apply the application plugin to add support for building a CLI application in Java.
<2> Use Maven Central for resolving dependencies.
<3> Use JUnit Jupiter for testing.
<4> This dependency is used by the application.
<5> Define the toolchain version.
<6> Define the main class for the application.
<7> Use JUnit Platform for unit tests.

The build script in the `app` subproject directory declares the dependencies the `app` code will need to be assembled and tested.

== Step 4. Review the Code

The file `app/src/main/java/authoring/tutorial/App.java` contains the main class of the project:

.App.java
[source, java]
----
package authoring.tutorial;

public class App {
    public String getGreeting() {
        return "Hello World!";
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(new App().getGreeting());
    }
}
----

The code prints out a simple "Hello World" greeting to the screen.

A test class is available at `app/src/test/java/authoring/tutorial/AppTest.java`:

.AppTest.java
[source, java]
----
package authoring.tutorial;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

class AppTest {
    @Test void appHasAGreeting() {
        App classUnderTest = new App();
        assertNotNull(classUnderTest.getGreeting(), "app should have a greeting");
    }
}
----

The generated test class has a single _JUnit Jupiter_ test.
The test instantiates the `App` class, invokes a method on it, and checks that it returns the expected value.

== Step 5. Run the App

The Application plugin, which was automatically added by `gradle init`, facilitates creating an executable JVM application:

[source, kotlin]
----
plugins {
    id("application")
}
----

Applying the Application plugin implicitly applies the Java plugin and adds tasks like `assemble`, `build`, and `run` to our project.

Thanks to the `application` plugin, you can run the application directly from the command line.
The `run` task tells Gradle to execute the `main` method in the class assigned to the `mainClass` property.

[source]
----
$ ./gradlew run

> Task :app:run
Hello World!

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 998ms
2 actionable tasks: 2 executed
----

== Step 6. Bundle the App

The `application` plugin packages the application, with all its dependencies, for you.
The archive will also contain a script to start the application with a single command.

Run `./gradlew build`:

[source]
----
$ ./gradlew build

> Task :app:compileJava
> Task :app:processResources NO-SOURCE
> Task :app:classes
> Task :app:jar
> Task :app:startScripts
> Task :app:distTar
> Task :app:distZip
> Task :app:assemble
> Task :app:compileTestJava
> Task :app:processTestResources NO-SOURCE
> Task :app:testClasses
> Task :app:test
> Task :app:check
> Task :app:build

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 5s
----

If you run a full build as shown above, Gradle will have produced the archive in two formats: `app/build/distributions/app.tar` and `app/build/distributions/app.zip`.

== Step 6. Publish a Build Scan

The best way to learn more about what your build is doing behind the scenes is to publish a link:https://scans.gradle.com[Build Scan].
To do so, run the `build` task again with the `--scan` flag.

[source]
----
$ ./gradlew build --scan
> Task :app:compileJava UP-TO-DATE
> Task :app:processResources NO-SOURCE
> Task :app:classes UP-TO-DATE
> Task :app:jar UP-TO-DATE
> Task :app:startScripts UP-TO-DATE
> Task :app:distTar UP-TO-DATE
> Task :app:distZip UP-TO-DATE
> Task :app:assemble UP-TO-DATE
> Task :app:compileTestJava UP-TO-DATE
> Task :app:processTestResources NO-SOURCE
> Task :app:testClasses UP-TO-DATE
> Task :app:test UP-TO-DATE
> Task :app:check UP-TO-DATE
> Task :app:build UP-TO-DATE

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1s
7 actionable tasks: 7 up-to-date
