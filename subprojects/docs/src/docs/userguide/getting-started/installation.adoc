[[installation]]
= Installing Gradle

You can install Gradle Build Tool on Linux, macOS, or Windows.

The installation can be done manually or using a package manager like https://sdkman.io/[SDKMAN!] or https://brew.sh/[Homebrew].

Please use the <<gradle_wrapper.adoc#sec:upgrading_wrapper,Gradle Wrapper>> to upgrade Gradle.
You can find all Gradle releases and their checksums on the link:{website}/releases[releases page].

[[sec:prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites
Gradle runs on all major operating systems. It requires link:{jdkDownloadUrl}[Java Development Kit] (JDK) version {minJdkVersion} or higher to run. You can check the <<compatibility.adoc#compatibility,compatibility matrix>> for more information.

To check, run `java -version`:

----
❯ java -version
openjdk version "11.0.18" 2023-01-17
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Homebrew (build 11.0.18+0)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Homebrew (build 11.0.18+0, mixed mode)
----

----
❯ java version "1.8.0_151"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_151-b12)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.151-b12, mixed mode)
----

Gradle uses the JDK it finds in your path, the JDK used by your IDE, or the JDK specified by your project.

----
echo $PATH
/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17/bin
----

You can also set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to a specific JDK installation directory.

----
❯ echo %JAVA_HOME%
C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_80
----

----
❯ echo $JAVA_HOME
/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-16.jdk/Contents/Home
----

Gradle supports Kotlin and Groovy as the main build languages.
Gradle ships with its own Kotlin and Groovy libraries, therefore they do not need to be installed.
Existing installations are ignored by Gradle.

<<compatibility.adoc#compatibility, See the full compatibility notes for Java, Groovy, Kotlin and Android.>>

== Linux installation

.Installing with a package manager
[%collapsible]
====

link:http://sdkman.io[SDKMAN!] is a tool for managing parallel versions of multiple Software Development Kits on most Unix-like systems (macOS, Linux, Cygwin, Solaris and FreeBSD).
Gradle is deployed and maintained by SDKMAN!:

----
❯ sdk install gradle
----

Other package managers are available, but the version of Gradle distributed by them is not controlled by Gradle, Inc.
Linux package managers may distribute a modified version of Gradle that is incompatible or incomplete when compared to the official version.
====

.Installing manually
[%collapsible]
====

**Step 1 - link:{website}/releases[Download] the latest Gradle distribution**

The distribution ZIP file comes in two flavors:

- Binary-only (bin)
- Complete (all) with docs and sources

We recommend downloading the bin file; it is a smaller file that is quick to download (and the latest documentation is available online).

**Step 2 - Unpack the distribution**

Unzip the distribution zip file in the directory of your choosing, e.g.:

[subs="attributes"]
----
❯ mkdir /opt/gradle
❯ unzip -d /opt/gradle gradle-{gradleVersion}-bin.zip
❯ ls /opt/gradle/gradle-{gradleVersion}
LICENSE  NOTICE  bin  README  init.d  lib  media
----

[[sec:linux_macos_users_2]]

**Step 3 - Configure your system environment**

To install Gradle, the path to the unpacked files needs to be in your Path.
Configure your `PATH` environment variable to include the `bin` directory of the unzipped distribution, e.g.:

[subs="attributes"]
----
❯ export PATH=$PATH:/opt/gradle/gradle-{gradleVersion}/bin
----

Alternatively, you could also add the environment variable `GRADLE_HOME` and point this to the unzipped distribution.
Instead of adding a specific version of Gradle to your `PATH`, you can add `$GRADLE_HOME/bin` to your `PATH`.
When upgrading to a different version of Gradle, simply change the `GRADLE_HOME` environment variable.

[subs="attributes"]
----
export GRADLE_HOME=/opt/gradle/gradle-{gradleVersion}
export PATH=${GRADLE_HOME}/bin:${PATH}
----

**Step 2 - Unpack the distribution**

Unzip the distribution zip file in the directory of your choosing, e.g.:

❯ mkdir /usr/local/gradle
❯ unzip gradle-{gradleVersion}-bin.zip -d /usr/local/gradle
❯ ls /usr/local/gradle/gradle-{gradleVersion}
LICENSE	NOTICE	README	bin	init.d	lib
----

**Step 3 - Configure your system environment**

To install Gradle, the path to the unpacked files needs to be in your Path.
Configure your `PATH` environment variable to include the `bin` directory of the unzipped distribution, e.g.:

[subs="attributes"]
----
❯ export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/gradle/gradle-{gradleVersion}/bin
----

Alternatively, you could also add the environment variable `GRADLE_HOME` and point this to the unzipped distribution.
Instead of adding a specific version of Gradle to your `PATH`, you can add `$GRADLE_HOME/bin` to your `PATH`.
When upgrading to a different version of Gradle, simply change the `GRADLE_HOME` environment variable.

It's a good idea to edit `.bash_profile` in your home directory to add `GRADLE_HOME` variable:

[subs="attributes"]
----
export GRADLE_HOME=/usr/local/gradle/gradle-{gradleVersion}
export PATH=$GRADLE_HOME/bin:$PATH
----

== Windows installation

**Step 1 - link:{website}/releases[Download] the latest Gradle distribution**

The distribution ZIP file comes in two flavors:

- Binary-only (bin)
- Complete (all) with docs and sources

We recommend downloading the bin file.

**Step 2 - Unpack the distribution**

Create a new directory `C:\Gradle` with **File Explorer**.

Open a second **File Explorer** window and go to the directory where the Gradle distribution was downloaded. Double-click the ZIP archive to expose the content.
Drag the `gradle-{gradleVersion}` directory to your newly created `C:\Gradle` folder.

Alternatively, you can unpack the Gradle distribution ZIP into `C:\Gradle` using the archiver tool of your choice.

**Step 3 - Configure your system environment**

To install Gradle, the path to the unpacked files needs to be in your Path.

In **File Explorer** right-click on the `This PC` (or `Computer`) icon, then click `Properties` -> `Advanced System Settings` -> `Environmental Variables`.

Under `System Variables` select `Path`, then click `Edit`.
Add an entry for `C:\Gradle\gradle-{gradleVersion}\bin`.
Click `OK` to save.

Alternatively, you can add the environment variable `GRADLE_HOME` and point this to the unzipped distribution.
Instead of adding a specific version of Gradle to your `Path`, you can add `__%GRADLE_HOME%__\bin` to your `Path`.
When upgrading to a different version of Gradle, just change the `GRADLE_HOME` environment variable.
