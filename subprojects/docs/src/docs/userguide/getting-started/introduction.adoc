[[introduction]]
= Introduction

Everyone has to start somewhere, and if you're new to Gradle, this is where to begin.

[[gs:installation]]
== Gradle Installation
If all you want to do is run an existing Gradle build, then you don't need to install Gradle if the build uses the <<gradle_wrapper#gradle_wrapper,Gradle Wrapper>>.
This is identifiable by the presence of the `gradlew` or `gradlew.bat` files in the root of the build.
You just need to make sure your system <<installation#sec:prerequisites,satisfies Gradle's prerequisites>>.

Android Studio comes with a working installation of Gradle, so you don't need to install Gradle separately when only working within that IDE.

To create a new build or add a Wrapper to an existing build, you will need to install Gradle <<installation.adoc#installation,according to these instructions>>.

If you need to install Gradle before the tutorial, you can do so in the <<installation.adoc#installation,installation section>>.

[[getting_started]]
== Getting Started with Gradle
The tutorial will take you from Gradle initialization all the way through to utilizing Gradle's task caching for your basic Java App. No previous experience is necessary but a basic knowledge of Java and Kotlin is nice to have.
