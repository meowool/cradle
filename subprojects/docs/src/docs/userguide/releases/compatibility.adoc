[[compatibility]]
= Compatibility Matrix

The sections below describe Gradle's compatibility with several integrations.
Versions not listed here may or may not work.

== Java
A Java version between 8 and 20 is required to execute Gradle.
Java 21 and later versions are not yet supported.

Java 6 and 7 can be used for <<building_java_projects.adoc#sec:java_cross_compilation,compilation>> but are deprecated for use with testing. Testing with Java 6 and 7 will not be supported in Gradle 9.0.

Any fully supported version of Java can be used for compilation or testing.
However, the latest Java version may only be supported for compilation or testing, not for running Gradle.
Support is achieved using <<toolchains#toolchains,toolchains>> and applies to all tasks supporting toolchains.

See the table below for the Java version supported by a specific Gradle release:
