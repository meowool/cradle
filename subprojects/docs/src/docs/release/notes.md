## Upgrade instructions

Switch your build to use Gradle @version@ by updating your wrapper:

`./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=@version@`

See the [Gradle 8.x upgrade guide](userguide/upgrading_version_8.html#changes_@baseVersion@) to learn about deprecations, breaking changes and other considerations when upgrading to Gradle @version@.

For Java, Groovy, Kotlin and Android compatibility, see the [full compatibility notes](userguide/compatibility.html).   

## New features and usability improvements

<!-- Do not add breaking changes or deprecations here! Add them to the upgrade guide instead. -->

<a name="FILL-IN-KEY-AREA"></a>
### FILL-IN-KEY-AREA improvements

<<<FILL IN CONTEXT FOR KEY AREA>>>
Example:
> The [configuration cache](userguide/configuration_cache.html) improves build performance by caching the result of
> the configuration phase. Using the configuration cache, Gradle can skip the configuration phase entirely when
> nothing that affects the build configuration has changed.

#### FILL-IN-FEATURE
> HIGHLIGHT the usecase or existing problem the feature solves
> EXPLAIN how the new release addresses that problem or use case
> PROVIDE a screenshot or snippet illustrating the new feature, if applicable
> LINK to the full documentation for more details

<a name="ear-plugin"></a>
### Ear Plugin

It is now possible to generate valid deployment descriptors for Java EE 8, Jakarta EE 9 and Jakarta EE 10
by specifying the corresponding version in the `deploymentDescriptor` instead of having to use a custom descriptor file.

```kotlin
tasks.ear {
    deploymentDescriptor {  // custom entries for application.xml:
        version = "10"
    }
}
```

<a name="wrapper-improvements"></a>
### Wrapper Improvements

The recommended way to execute any Gradle build is with the help of the [Gradle Wrapper](userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) (in short just “Wrapper”).
The Wrapper invokes a declared version of Gradle, downloading it beforehand if necessary.

#### Smaller Wrapper JAR

The Wrapper JAR file size was reduced from ~65K down to ~45K by eliminating dead code.

#### Wrapper JAR LICENSE File

The Wrapper JAR now contains a `META-INF/LICENSE` file.
This alleviates any doubts about the licensing of the Wrapper JAR file.
Like the Gradle Build Tool, its Wrapper is licensed under the Apache Software License 2.0.
The JAR file is now self-attributing and you don't need to consider whether you need to add a separate `LICENSE` file whenever you place that JAR file in your codebases.


<a name="kotlin-dsl"></a>
### Kotlin DSL improvements

Gradle's [Kotlin DSL](userguide/kotlin_dsl.html) provides an enhanced editing experience in supported IDEs compared to the traditional Groovy DSL — auto-completion, smart content assist, quick access to documentation, navigation to source, and context-aware refactoring.

#### Version catalog API in precompiled scripts

The `versionCatalogs` extension accessor is now available in Kotlin DSL precompiled scripts.
It provides a [type unsafe API](userguide/platforms.html#sub:type-unsafe-access-to-catalog) for accessing version catalogs available on the projects where the precompiled script will be applied.

```kotlin
// buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/my-convention-plugin.gradle.kts
versionCatalogs.named("libs").findLibrary("assertj-core").ifPresent { assertjCore ->
    dependencies {
        testImplementation(assertjCore)
    }
}
```

Check the [version catalog API](javadoc/org/gradle/api/artifacts/VersionCatalog.html) for all supported methods.
